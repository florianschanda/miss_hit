    <section>
      <h2>Using MISS_HIT Tools</h2>
      <div>
	All MISS_HIT tools (except mh_diff) are built on the same
	framework, so they share many common aspects. For example
	the <a href="configuration.html">configuration files</a>, but
	also the command-line interface.
      </div>

      <div>
	All tools have two operating modes:
	<ul>
	  <li>Ad-hoc mode (the default)</li>
	  <li>Project mode</li>
	</ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Ad-hoc mode</h3>
      <div>
        To analyse one or more files, you don't need to do anything
        special. Just call the tool and provide the files you want to
        analyze. For example, this style checks <tt>my_file.m</tt>:
        <pre>$ mh_style my_file.m</pre>

	You can also provide directories. In this example we use the
	bug-finder to analyze <tt>other_file.m</tt>, and all
	applicable files in <tt>some_directory</tt> or its
	sub-directories:
        <pre>$ mh_lint other_file.m some_directory</pre>

	Finally, omitting files or directories will analyze all files
	in the current working directory and all its
	sub-directories. For example, this produces code metrics for
	all files:
        <pre>$ mh_metric</pre>
      </div>

      <h3>Project mode</h3>
      <div>
	Note: project mode is work in progress. Do not yet rely on it
	working.
      </div>
      <div>
	Project mode is intended for larger projects, or multiple
	projects in one source tree (possibly sharing some common
	code). Project mode <i>requires</i> one or
	more <a href="configuration.html">configuration files</a>,
	declaring at least one library or entry point. To analyze a
	project, indicate its name with the <tt>--entry-point</tt>
	parameter. For example, to produce code metrics for the potato
	project:

        <pre>$ mh_metric --entry-point=potato_app.m</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
	Project mode will also be required for advanced static
	analysis in mh_lint and mh_bmc (since it defines the search
	order and location for user-defined functions and classes).
      </div>

      <div>
	Project mode is also helpful for users that maintain a large
	shared cope-base with multiple entry points. A common use case
	is to produce a code metric report, but only for the bits
	you're responsible for or are delivering: defining an
	entry-point or library provides you with a convenient
	short-hand instead of having to remember each time which
	directories/files you're responsible for.
      </div>

      <div>
	Please note that MISS_HIT will <i>not</i> consider files and
	directories that would be invisible to MATLAB in project
	mode. Consider for example a projet layout like this:
<pre>
  /
    miss_hit.cfg
    file1.m
    foo/
      file2.m
    +bar/
      file3.m
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
	The configuration file contains the following information:
	<pre>entrypoint "Potato" {}</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
	When running MISS_HIT without project mode, all files are
	considered. However, when running MISS_HIT in project mode,
	only files <tt>file1.m</tt> and <tt>file3.m</tt> are
	considered. File <tt>file2.m</tt> is not considered because
	directory <tt>foo</tt> is not on the path, as declared in our
	entrypoint.
      </div>

      <div>
	If you want to include <tt>file2.m</tt> in your analysis, then
	you have to include that directory in your entry point, like
	so:
<pre>
entrypoint "Potato" {
  paths {
    ".",
    "foo"
  }
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
	This behaviour is consistent with how MATLAB deals with its
	search path. For more information consult:
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/files-and-folders-that-matlab-accesses.html"><img src="assets/external-link.svg"> Files and Folders that MATLAB Accesses</a></li>
	  <li><a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/organizing-classes-in-folders.html"><img src="assets/external-link.svg"> Folders Containing Class Definitions</a></li>
	</ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Common options</h3>
      <div>
	All MISS_HIT tools (except mh_diff) have these options. Some
	MISS_HIT tools have command-line additional options, which are
	described in the relevant tool user manuals.
      </div>

      <h4>--version</h4>
      <div>
	Displays tool version and quits.
      </div>

      <h4>--include-version</h4>
      <div>
	Show the tool version as the very first thing, but continue
	running as normal. This is helpful when debugging e.g. CI
	issues.
      </div>

      <h4>FILE | DIRECTORY</h4>
      <div>
	Can be specified more than once. Causes tool to analyze the
	given file or directory. If not given, causes the tool will
	analyze the entire working directory and all its
	sub-directories.
      </div>

      <h4><a name="entry-point">--entry-point=NAME</a></h4>
      <div>
	Specifies an entry point (as declared in a configuration
	file). When combined with additional file or directory
	arguments, the tool analyzes only that sub-set of the
	specified entry-point.
      </div>

      <h4>--single</h4>
      <div>
	By default MISS_HIT uses multi-threaded analysis, which for
	large projects can significantly speed up analysis time. Using
	this option turns off this feature. This can be useful for
	debugging.
      </div>

      <div>
	Note: you do <i>not</i> need to use this option to get a
	predictable report or error messages! Messages and reports are
	always sorted.
      </div>

      <h4>--ignore-config</h4>
      <div>
	Do not attempt to parse configuration files.
      </div>

      <h4>--input-encoding</h4>
      <div>
	By default this is cp1252. This option can be used to override
	the input encoding we use to parse m files. Note that this is
	not applicable to Simulink models, since they contain the
	correct encoding to use.
      </div>

      <div>
	You can specify
	any <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings">valid
	Python input encoding</a> here.
      </div>

      <h4>--brief</h4>
      <div>
	By default error messages come with a bit of context to help
	you identify the issue. For example:
<pre>
In add_one.m, line 3
|     rv = x + 1;
|            ^ check (medium): operation saturates for some inputs
In add_one.m, line 3
|     rv = x + 1;
|            ^ info: counter-example trace: x = 2147483647
</pre>
	Using the brief option trims this down to one line per
	message, as shown below. This is especially useful for
        integration into IDEs.
<pre>
add_one.m:3:11: check (medium): operation saturates for some inputs
add_one.m:3:11: info: counter-example trace: x = 2147483647
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>--octave</h4>
      <div>
	By default, MISS_HIT assumes a recent version of MATLAB. This
	option adds some support for Octave, but please note that this
	is quite limited. For now only the <tt>#</tt> comments are
	supported.
      </div>
      <div>
	Please
	see <a href="https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit/issues/43">issue
	  #43</a> for outstanding features.
      </div>

      <h4>--ignore-pragmas</h4>
      <div>
	Ignores the special <a href="pragmas.html">pragmas</a> that
	MISS_HIT supports.
      </div>

      <h4>--ignore-justifications-with-tickets</h4>
      <div>
	Ignore justification pragmas that mention a ticket. The use
	case here are justifications put into the code, which really
	are temporary justifications, e.g: "its ok for now, but we'll
	fix it in ticket ABC-123". For example you might want to
	process these normally during CI, but may want to check from
	time to time so that you can reduce technical debt.
      </div>

      <h4>--debug-show-path</h4>
      <div>
	Debug/developer option. This displays the search PATH for
	resolving user-defined functions and classes.
      </div>
