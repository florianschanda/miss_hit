      <a href="index.html">MISS_HIT</a> includes a linter tool
      (<span class="file">mh_lint</span>). It is a classic
      bug-finding tool that focusses on code quality that is
      automatic, but not sound or complete.

      <div>
        This tool is extremely limited. What it does is helpful, but
        it doesn't do much and is <i>not</i> a replacement for
        e.g. <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mlint.html">mlint</a>
        or <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/checkcode.html">checkcode</a>.

      <h2>Classification</h2>
      <div>
        MISS_HIT Lint issues "check" messages for any potential
        problem it detects. These are further classified into three
        categories:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>low</b> - These are problems that MISS_HIT is somewhat
            unsure about if it is a problem or not, or problems that -
            if they manifest - are unlikely to be silently undetected
            bugs. Something that makes your entire program crash or
            obviously doesn't work is not as bad as something that
            quitely mis-behaves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>high</b> - These are problems that MISS_HIT is very
            sure will cause major problems. Fix these!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>medium</b> - Anything else.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Checks</h2>

      <h3>Incomplete block comments</h3>
      <div>
        Block comments are special comments that span multiple
        lines. The documentation states that they must appear on their
        own line without any other text surrounding them, otherwise
        the behaviour is left undefined.

        MH Lint emits a check on all comments that may be block
        comments, for example:
<pre>
disp 1;
%{
disp 2; %{
disp 3;
%}
disp 4;
%}
disp 5;
</pre>
        The second block comment is not actually a block comment
        (creating the first warning). The third comment closes the
        first comment; but the last one does not close the second,
        since it's not a block comment (creating the second warning).

        The output of this code is 1, 4, 5 which is maybe not what you
        would expect.
      </div>

      <h3>Chaining relational operators</h3>
      <div>
        It is possible to chain operators, e.g. 1 + 2 + 3 which
        performs as expected. However it is also possible to chain
        relational operators, which does not work as expected:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
lower = 5;
upper = 20;
if lower &lt; var &lt; upper
   disp('var is in bounds');
else
   disp('error: var is not in bounds');
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        This condition always evaluates to true. Lets say var is
        100. Chained operators are evaluated left-to-right, lower &lt;
        var will evaluate to 1, which in turn means 1 &lt; upper is
        always true.
      </div>

      <div>
        MH Lint emits a check on all chained relations.
      </div>

      <h3>Shadowing of built-in functions ("builtin_shadow")</h3>
      <div>
        This rule attempts to find cases where we assign to, or
        shadow, a MATLAB&reg; builtin function (e.g. re-defining false
        to be 1). For assignments, this rule works on a hand-curated
        list of "high impact" built-in functions, where it is likely
        this re-definition will result in confusion. So we complain
        e.g. about "true", but we do not complain about "bar". For
        script files, function files, and class files we check a much
        broader set of built-ins.
      </div>

      <h3>Filename matching entity within</h3>
      <div>
        A class or top-level function must match the name of the file
        it is declared in: other functions can only reliably access it
        if this is the case. If it does not match, you must use the
        name of the file instead of the function or class name, which
        is just not right.
      </div>

      <h3>Name-value pairs in function calls</h3>
      <div>
        This is a new (since MATLAB&reg; 2021a) and extremely confusing use
        of = in function calls. It means something completely
        different to what it means in any other language, it also
        clashes with Octave, and finally it is next to impossible to
        parse correctly.
      </div>
      <div>
        Consider for example: <pre>foo(a=b);</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>In MATLAB&reg; &lt; 2021a, this is just a syntax error.</li>
          <li>
            In MATLAB&reg; &gt;= 2021a, this is actually two arguments, and
            is equivalent to <pre>foo('a', b)</pre>

            Note that this is totally different to what you'd expect
            if you come from e.g. Python or Ada.
          </li>
          <li>In Octave, this is a side-effect assignment to a, so is
            equivalent to
<pre>
a = b;
foo(b);
</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        It gets worse, when you consider how to parse or semantically
        analyze the code fragment <pre>foo(a=b)</pre> Is it allowed or
        not?

        This may depend on the calling context, for example
        if <tt>foo</tt> is a lambda function it would be fine, but if
        it is an array, it is not.
      </div>

      <h3>Contents.m only contains comments</h3>
      <div>
        A file called <tt>Contents.m</tt> must only contain comments,
        as it
        has <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-a-help-summary-contents-m.html">special
        significance</a> for the MATLAB&reg; help system.
      </div>

      <h3>Correct format for TestTags</h3>
      <div>
        The required syntax for TestTags
        is <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/tag-unit-tests.html">documented,
        but subtle</a>. We've seen some cases where incorrect TestTags
        cause the entire test to be silently ignored; so to guard
        against this MH Lint enforces the correct syntax.
