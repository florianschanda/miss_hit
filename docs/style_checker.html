  <main>
    <div class="section">
      <a href="index.html">MISS_HIT</a> includes a simple style
      checker (<span class="file">mh_style.py</span>). It can detect
      and correct (when the --fix options given) a number of coding
      style issues, most of which are configurable.
    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Using MISS_HIT Style</h2>
      <div>
        The easiest way to use the style checker is to just invoke it
        on the command-line:
      </div>

      <div>
        To analyse a single file:
        <pre>$ mh_style.py my_file.m</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        To analyse all files in a directory tree:
        <pre>$ mh_style.py src/</pre>
      </div>

      <h3>Setting up configuration in your project (a worked example)</h3>
      <div>
        However, it is very likely that you do not like all default
        options. MISS_HIT can be configured for projects using
        configuration files which must be
        named <span class="file">miss_hit.cfg</span>
        (or <span class="file">.miss_hit</span>, this alternative
        exists for people who do not want to have them visible).
      </div>

      <div>
        The configuration system is based on inheriting options. This
        is best explained by example. Lets say we have a project that
        has the following structure:
<pre>
foo/
foo/foo_main.m
foo/lib/potato.m
foo/lib/kitten.m
foo/external/some_toolkit.m
</pre>
        We have a main program, some library code, but we also use an
        external toolkit that we've included for convenience.
      </div>

      <div>
        Lets say we want to configure a tab-width of 8 for our
        project. We then place a new file in the tree at
        <span class="file">foo/miss_hit.cfg</span> that contains the
        following:
        <pre>tab_width: 8</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        However, now we get tons of warnings for the external tool-kit
        if we just run miss_hit in the project root. We can exclude
        this directory by adding the following to our config file:
        <pre>exclude_dir: "external"</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Finally, we want to relax the line length to 120 characters
        for our library, but not for anything else. To do this we
        create another config file
        in <span class="file">foo/lib/miss_hit.cfg and</span> write:

        <pre>line_length: 120</pre>

        Note that we do not have to repeat the tab-width, this setting
        is inherited from <span class="file">foo/miss_hit.cfg</span>.
      </div>

      <div>
        Our tree now looks like this:
<pre>
foo/
foo/miss_hit.cfg
foo/foo_main.m
foo/lib/miss_hit.cfg
foo/lib/potato.m
foo/lib/kitten.m
foo/external/some_toolkit.m
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Now, when running the style checker on a file or directory the
        correct settings are automatically applied, using the entire
        tree of configuration.
      </div>

      <h3>Configuration on the command-line</h3>

      <div>
        Some options (like line length) can also be configured on the
        command-line. Command-line options are intended to be
        temporary, and they take precedence over any options specified
        in config files.
      </div>

      <div>
        Options are usually read from configuration
        files <span class="file">miss_hit.cfg</span>. This behaviour
        can be disabled entirely with the --ignore-config option.
      </div>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Configuration file syntax reference</h2>
      <div>
        In general the config files follow a simply sytax:
        <pre>key: value</pre> The key is some identifier like
        tab_width, and the value is the configuration for that
        key. Integers are written directly, and strings are enclosed
        in double quotes. Comments start with #.
      </div>

      <h3>Enable/disable analysis ("enable")</h3>

      <div>
        A special entry "enable" into
        a <span class="file">miss_hit.cfg</span> can be used to enable
        or disable analysis for the subtree.
      </div>

      <div>
        For example if you have a lot of legacy code you can put this
        into your root configuration:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
enable: 0
line_length: 100
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        And then enable analysis for some subdirectories, e.g. in
        <span class="file">foo/new_code/miss_hit.cfg</span> you can
        write:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
enable: 1
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Like any other option, the "closest one" takes
        precedence. Specifically this means you can disable for a
        large tree, and enable again for specific sub-trees.
      </div>

      <h3>Excluding directories ("exclude_dir")</h3>

      <div>
        You can also specify the special "exclude_dir" property in
        configuration files. This property must name a directory
        directly inside (i.e. you can't
        specify <span class="file">foo/bar</span>) the same directory
        the configuration file resides in. This is especially useful
        when including an external repository, over which we have
        limited control.
      </div>

      <div>
        This is a much more drastic option that "enable: 0", since
        this permanently excludes a tree from analysis. It cannot be
        turned on again since the tool will never search excluded
        directories.
      </div>

      <div>
        Below is given a more realistic root configuration:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
file_length: 1000
line_length: 120
copyright_entity: "Potato Inc."

# We include the delightful
# miss_hit tools in our repo,
# but don't want to accidentally
# check their weird test cases
exclude_dir: "miss_hit"
</pre>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h1>Justifications</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <div>
        Style issues can be justified by placing "mh:ignore_style"
        into a comment or line continuation. The justification applies
        to all style issues on that line. Please refer
        to <a href="pragmas.html">MISS_HIT Pragmas</a> for a full
        description of all pragmas understood by MISS_HIT.

    <div class="title">
      <img src="assets/edit.svg" alt="Style Rules" />
      <h1>Style Rules</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <div>
        There are three types of rules:
      </div>

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Mandatory rules</b>: they are always active and can be
            automatically fixed
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Autofix rules</b>: they are optional and can be
            automatically fixed
          </li>
          <li><b>Rules</b>: they are optional and cannot be
            automatically fixed
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        Rules with a name (for example "whitespace_keywords") can be
        individually suppressed in or re-enabled in configuration files. For
        example:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
suppress_rule: "builtin_shadow"
enable_rule: "file_length"
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        By default all rules are active.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mandatory rules</h2>
      <div>
        These rules are always active. The technical reason for this is
        that it would be too difficult to autofix issues without
        autofixing these. If you pay me an excessive amount of money I
        could look into this but I'd rather keep the lexer vaguely
        sane. All of them are automatically fixed
        by <span class="file">mh_style.py</span> when the --fix option
        is specified.
      </div>

      <!-- HOOK: MANDATORY RULES -->
      <h4>Trailing newlines at end of file</h4>
      <div>
        This mandatory rule makes sure there is a single trailing newline
        at the end of a file.
      </div>

      <h4>Consecutive blank lines</h4>
      <div>
        This rule allows a maximum of one blank line to separate code blocks.
        Comments are not considered blank lines.
      </div>

      <h4>Use of tab</h4>
      <div>
        This rule enforces the absence of the tabulation character
        *everywhere*. When auto-fixing, a tab-width of 4 is used by default,
        but this can be configured with the options &#x27;tab_width&#x27;.
      </div>

      <div>
        Note that the fix replaces the tab everywhere, including in strings
        literals. This means
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
&quot;a&lt;tab&gt;b&quot;
   &quot;a&lt;tab&gt;b&quot;
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        might be fixed to
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
&quot;a        b&quot;
   &quot;a     b&quot;
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Which may or may not what you had intended originally. I am not sure
        if this is a bug or a feature, but either way it would be *painful* to
        change so I am going to leave this as is.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>tab_width</b>: Tab-width, by default 4.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Trailing whitespace</h4>
      <div>
        This rule enforces that there is no trailing whitespace in your files.
        You *really* want to do this, even if the MATLAB default editor makes
        this really hard. The reason is that it minimises conflicts when using
        modern version control systems.
      </div>

      <!-- END HOOK: MANDATORY RULES -->
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Autofix rules</h2>
      <div>
        The following rules are automatically fixed
        by <span class="file">mh_style.py</span> when the --fix option
        is specified.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace surrounding commas ("whitespace_comma")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace after commas, and no whitespace
        before commas, e.g. 'foo, bar, baz'.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace surrounding colon ("whitespace_colon")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces no whitespace around colons, except after
        commas.
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace around assignment ("whitespace_assignment")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace around the assignment operation
        (=).
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace surrounding brackets ("whitespace_brackets")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace after square and round brackets,
        and no whitespace before their closing counterpart. For
        example: [foo, bar]
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace after some words ("whitespace_keywords")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure there is whitespace after some words such
        as "if" or "properties".
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace in comments ("whitespace_comments")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure there is some whitespace between the
        comment character (%) and the rest of the comment. The exception
        is "divisor" comments like "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%" and the pragmas such
        as "%#codegen".
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace in continuation ("whitespace_continuation")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure there is some whitespace between the last
        thing on a line and a line continuation.
      </div>

      <h4>Continuations followed by terminators ("useless_continuation")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule flags up line continuations that are followed by
        things that would end the statement anyway. For example:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
if potato ...

    x = 1;
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>Dangerously misleading continuations ("dangerous_continuation")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule identifies continuations that are one code change
        away from introducing difficult to find bugs. In MATLAB /
        Octave statements are usually terminated by a ; and a newline,
        but there are a few places where nothing is required. Consider
        this example:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
if potato ...
    if kitten
        x = 1;
    end
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        Since the expression for the if-guard does not need
        termination, the continuation here just happens to work. This
        rule removes these continuations (or replaces them with
        comments).
      </div>

      <h4>Whitespace around operators ("operator_whitespace")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule makes sure binary operators (except for the power
        operators) are surrounded by whitespace, and unary operators
        are not followed by whitespace. Like so:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
x = -foo + bar;
y = x^2;
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>Consistent semicolons ("end_of_statements")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces consistent statement terminators. It
        effectively bans commas and requires semicolons + newline at
        the end of most statements. The exceptions are things like
        'return' or the end of compound statements such as 'if'.
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
x = y, y = z;   % commas not allowed
x = y; y = z;;  % newline required, and spurious semicolon
if foo;         % useless semicolon
   disp hello   % missing semicolon
end;            % useless semicolon
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        All of these issues can be auto-fixed, if the indentation rule
        is enabled. Otherwise only the subset of issues that does not
        require adding newlines can be fixed.
      </div>

      <h4>Indentation ("indentation")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces consistent indentation and line
        continuations. It fixes indentation, but leaves the exact
        amount of extra whitespace added for continuations untouched
        (for now).
      </div>

      <div>
        While indentation is usually a popular religious flame-war
        topic, in MATLAB there is not so much room for creativity. The
        main reason for this is that the language lacks brackets for
        blocks. If you do feel that you have a specific indentation
        style that is not catered for here please raise an issue and I
        will see what I can do. For now there is just one style.
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
if potato
    disp (['Hello', ...
           ' World!']);
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        In this example there is no indentation for the if since it is
        the top-level statement in a script. The call to disp is
        indented, since it is part of a compound statement. The
        continuation is indented to the same level, but the extra
        offset (7 spaces in this example) is preserved. If you change
        the setting of tab_width at any point, this means that the
        continuation is still properly aligned.
      </div>

      <div>
        The following constructs cause indentation:
        <ul>
          <li>Any compound statements (e.g. if, switch, etc.)</li>
          <li>Function and class definitions</li>
          <li>The four special blocks (properties, methods,
            enumeration, or events) inside classes</li>
          <li>The argument validation block for functions</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>tab_width</b>: Indent by this many spaces. By default
            this is 4.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Redundant brackets ("redundant_brackets")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces removes some brackets that are clearly
        useless: top-level brackets and double brackets. Brackets that
        have been added to clarify operator precedence are not
        touched.
      </div>

      <div>
        This is an example of redundant brackets:
<pre>
if (potato)
    x = ((x + 1));
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        This set of brackets are technically redundant due to operator
        precedence, but they are left alone since they were probably
        added for clarity:
<pre>
  x = (a * b) + (b * c);
</pre>
      </div>

      <h4>Annotation whitespace ("annotation_whitespace")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces whitespace after the annotation indication,
        i.e. we we make sure things look like this:
        <pre>%| pragma Potato;</pre>
      </div>

      <!-- HOOK: AUTOFIX RULES -->
      <!-- END HOOK: AUTOFIX RULES -->
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <div>
        These rules cannot be auto-fixed because there is no "obvious"
        fix.
      </div>

      <h4>Copyright notice ("copyright_notice")</h4>

      <div>
        This rules looks for a copyright notice at the beginning of each
        file in the form of "(C) Copyright YEAR-YEAR ENTITY" or "(C)
        Copyright YEAR ENTITY". The list of acceptable entities can be
        configured with copyright_entity. This option can be given more
        than once to permit a set of valid copyright holders. If this
        options is not set, the rule just looks for any copyright
        notice.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>copyright_entity</b>: Can be specified more than
            once. Make sure each copyright notice mentions one of these.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Shadowing of built-in functions ("builtin_shadow")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule attempts to find cases where we assign to a MATLAB
        builtin function (e.g. re-defining false to be 1). Note: this
        rule works on a hand-curated list of "high impact" built-in
        functions, where it is likely this re-definition will result
        in confusion. So we complain e.g. about "true", but we do not
        complain about "bar".
      </div>

      <h4>Naming scheme for classes ("naming_classes")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces a consistent naming for all user-defined
        classes.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>regex_class_name</b>: A regular expression that every
            class must match. By default it is:
            <pre>([A-Z]+|[A-Z][a-z]*)(_([A-Z]+|[A-Z][a-z]*|[0-9]+))*</pre>
            This regular expression encodes the "Ada" naming scheme
            which is in my opinion probably the most descriptive and
            consistent naming scheme. It requires underscore-separated
            acronyms or capitalised words. Good class names under this
            scheme are:
            <ul>
              <li>Kitten_Class</li>
              <li>LASER</li>

      <h4>Naming scheme for functions ("naming_functions")</h4>

      <div>
        This rule enforces a consistent naming for all user-defined
        functions and methods.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>regex_function_name</b>: A regular expression that
            every ordinary function must match. The default is the
            same as it is for classes. (See above.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>regex_nested_name</b>: A regular expression that every
            nested function must match. The default is the same as it
            is for classes. (See above.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>regex_method_name</b>: A regular expression that
            every class method must match. The default is
            <pre>[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)*</pre> This is all lower-case,
            underscore separated names.

      <!-- HOOK: RULES -->
      <h4>Maximum file length ("file_length")</h4>
      <div>
        This is configurable with &#x27;file_length&#x27;. It is a good idea to keep
        the length of your files under some limit since it forces your
        project into avoiding the worst spaghetti code.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>file_length</b>: Maximum lines in a file, 1000 by default.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Max characters per line ("line_length")</h4>
      <div>
        This is configurable with &#x27;line_length&#x27;, default is 80. It is a
        good idea for readability to avoid overly long lines. This can help
        you avoid extreme levels of nesting and avoids having to scroll
        around.
      </div>

      <div>
        Configuration parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>

      <h1>Semantic warnings</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <div>
        The style checker parses the program, and as such some
        lint-style warnings are generated about suspicious
        constructs. These cannot be suppressed or justified.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Incomplete block comments</h2>
      <div>
        Block comments are special comments that span multiple
        lines. The documentation states that they must appear on their
        own line without any other text surrounding them, otherwise
        the behaviour is left undefined.

        The MISS_HIT lexer warns about all comments that may be block
        comments, for example:
<pre>
disp 1;
%{
disp 2; %{
disp 3;
%}
disp 4;
%}
disp 5;
</pre>
        The second block comment is not actually a block comment
        (creating the first warning). The third comment closes the
        first comment; but the last one does not close the second,
        since it's not a block comment (creating the second warning).

        The output of this code is 1, 4, 5 which is maybe not what you
        would expect.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chaining relational operators</h2>
      <div>
        It is possible to chain operators, e.g. 1 + 2 + 3 which
        performs as expected. However it is also possible to chain
        relational operators, which does not work as expected:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
lower = 5;
upper = 20;
if lower &lt; var &lt; upper
   disp('var is in bounds');
else
   disp('error: var is not in bounds');
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        This condition always evaluates to true. Lets say var is
        100. Chained operators are evaluated left-to-right, lower &lt;
        var will evaluate to 1, which in turn means 1 &lt; upper is
        always true.
      </div>

      <div>
        MISS_HIT emits a warning on all chained relations.
      </div>
