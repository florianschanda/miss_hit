      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div>
        Tracing your code and tests to your requirements and
        specification is a common activity when developing to safety
        standards (such as ISO 26262 or DO-178C). While you definitely
        should not be using MATLAB for this, it is not my place to
        judge; and so we have a tool to support this
        activity. <tt>mh_trace</tt> can extract tags put in code,
        tests, and Simulink models and generate
        a <a href="https://github.com/bmw-software-engineering/lobster/blob/main/docs/schemas.md">LOBSTER
        trace</a> files that a different tool (such as LOBSTER) can
        use to generate a traceability report.
      </div>

      <div>
        The MATLAB language already includes some features
        (<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/tag-unit-tests.html">TestTags</a>)
        to help you annotate tests; consider this example (taken from
        the MathWorks website):
      </div>
      <div>
<pre>
classdef (TestTags = {'FeatureB'}) ...
        ExampleTagClassTest < matlab.unittest.TestCase
    methods (Test)
        function testF (testCase)
            % test code
        end
    end
    methods (Test, TestTags = {'FeatureC','System'})
        function testG (testCase)
            % test code
        end
    end
    methods (Test, TestTags = {'System','FeatureA'})
        function testH (testCase)
            % test code
        end
    end
end
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
        Running <tt>mh_trace</tt> will generate two lobster files (by
        default <tt>mh_imp_trace.lobster</tt> for code and models,
        and <tt>mh_act_trace.lobster</tt> for tests) that shows which
        tags affect any given function. Here shown is a snippet for
        the testG function:
<pre>
    {
      "framework": "MATLAB",
      "just_down": [],
      "just_global": [],
      "just_up": [],
      "kind": "Test",
      "location": {
        "column": 17,
        "file": "ExampleTagClassTest.m",
        "kind": "file",
        "line": 11
      },
      "name": "ExampleTagClassTest::testG",
      "refs": [
        "req FeatureB",
        "req FeatureC",
        "req System"
      ],
      "status": null,
      "tag": "matlab ExampleTagClassTest::testG"
    },
</pre>
      </div>

      <h3>Annotating code</h3>
      <div>
        While TestTags can be used to annotate tests, it cannot be
        used to annotate code. To trace code, MISS_HIT supports a
        special pragma:
        <pre>%| pragma Tag("potato-req-1");</pre>
        You can also give more than one tag in a single Tag pragma:
        <pre>%| pragma Tag("potato-req-1", "kitten-req-42");</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
        Pragma tag applies to all items scoped logically under the
        entity that is tagged. For example placing the Tag pragma in a
        class definition will affect all methods; placing it in a
        function will also affect all nested functions; and placing it
        in a compilation unit will affect all functions or methods in
        that compilation unit.
      </div>
      <div>
        Note: this pragma can also be used to tag tests. There is no
        difference between using this pragma and adding a TestTags
        property to tests.
      </div>

      <h3>Annotating models</h3>
      <h4>With text annotations</h4>
      <div>
	Simply place an annotation anywhere in your block. If the text
	contains a line that starts with <tt>lobster-trace:</tt> then
	it is interpreted as a tracing tag.
	<figure>
	  <img src="subsystem_annotation_example.png" height="250">
	  <figcaption>
	    Example showing usage of annotations for tracing
	  </figcaption>
	</figure>

	You may place as many of these annotations as you wish, and
	any formatting (a feature of more recent Simulink releases) is
	ignored.
      </div>

      <h4>With area annotations</h4>
      <div>
	You may also use area annotations. Note however that the
	grouping is irrelevant, the traceable item that these tags
	relate to are the enclosing system or sub-system; similar to a
	text annotation.
	<figure>
	  <img src="area_annotation_example.png" height="150">
	  <figcaption>
	    Example showing usage of area annotations for tracing
	  </figcaption>
	</figure>

	The point of these is to make it easier for the human to see
	what is going on in larger systems. If you want a more
	fine-grained tracing you still need to chop up your larger
	system into several smaller sub-systems; similar to a large
	spaghetti MATLAB function.
      </div>

      <h4>With block properties</h4>
      <div>
	Another option is to
	use <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/block-properties-dialog-box.html">block
	properties</a>, using <tt>lobster-trace: foo.bar</tt> just like
	above.
	<figure>
	  <img src="block_property_example.png" height="300">
	  <figcaption>
	    Example showing usage of block properties for tracing
	  </figcaption>
	</figure>

	If the block is sub-system, then the tracing tags apply
	to the sub-system (i.e. you would get the same behaviour if
	you enter the sub-system and place the annotation there). If
	the block is not a sub-system (e.g. a in-port or an adder,
	etc.) then the annotation will apply to the system or
	sub-system containing the block (i.e. you would get the same
	behaviour if you just put a annotation somewhere in the system
	containing the block).
      </div>

      <h3>Excluding code</h3>
      <div>
        Most projects have some code for e.g. setting up the workspace
        or build scripts. This code is not part of the delivery and so
        should not make it into the requirements traceability report;
        it can be excluded using the <tt>No_Tracing</tt> pragma:

        <pre>%| pragma No_Tracing;</pre>

        This pragma has identical scoping rules as pragma Tag, and
        completely removes the affected functions from the json
        output. If you place it at the top of a file, it excludes all
        functions in that compilation unit. If a function is affected
        by both Tags and a No_Tracing pragma then the No_Tracing
        pragma takes precedence.
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Command-line interface</h2>
      <h4>--out-imp FILE</h4>
      <div>
        By default we produce a file
        called <tt>mh_imp_trace.lobster</tt> for code and models. With
        this option you can change the filename.
      </div>

      <h4>--out-act FILE</h4>
      <div>
        By default we produce a file
        called <tt>mh_act_trace.lobster</tt> for tests. With this
        option you can change the filename.
      </div>

      <h4>--only-tagged-blocks</h4>
      <div>
        By default we produce list all blocks in a Simulink model or
        library, with this option we only include the ones that have
        at least one tag.
      </div>

      <h4>--untagged-blocks-inherit-tags</h4>
      <div>
        If this option is set, then a Simulink sub-system that does
        not have its own tags will inherit the tags from its enclosing
        system. Once new tags are encountered, they will be used. Note
        that this option does not affect embedded MATLAB blocks.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <div>
        The tool will only extract tags from the files that MISS_HIT
        normally processes. So if you have your unit tests excluded
        from MISS_HIT then you will get no tracing. You could use the
        common <tt>--ignore-config</tt> option to work around this; or
        even better: don not exclude your unit tests.
