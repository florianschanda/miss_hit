      The behaviour of the <a href="index.html">MISS_HIT</a> tools can
      be controlled with configuration files. This document describes
      the syntax and semantics of these files, and provides a more
      general explanation of how to set up and configure MISS_HIT for
      your projects.

      <h1>Setting up MISS_HIT</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Setting up a new project</h2>
      <div>
	For new projects we recommend to apply MISS_HIT
	project-wide. Create a configuration file
	named <tt>miss_hit.cfg</tt> and place it at the root of the
	project containing:
<pre>
project_root
copyright_entity: "Your Name"
</pre>
        This configuration file applies to all files in this directory
        and any sub-directories.
      </div>
      <div>
	Individual sub-directories can be separately
	configured. Configuration files placed in sub-directories
	inherit all settings from their parent directory, except for
	the ones changed by such a file. For example if you have a
	directory containing auto-generated code
	(called <tt>src/autogen</tt>) that you do not want to check
	you can selectively disable analysis by creating a new
	configuration file <tt>src/autogen/miss_hit.cfg</tt>
	containing:
	<pre>enable: false</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	The configuration files apply to all MISS_HIT tools. The
	general file format and syntax is described in this
	document. The specific settings applicable to each tool are
	described in the user manuals of each tool.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Applying MISS_HIT to an existing project</h2>
      <div>
	MISS_HIT has special support for legacy projects. The
	following process is recommended:
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Create top-level configuration file setting up all
	    rules, but turning MISS_HIT off. For example:
<pre>
project_root
enable: false
copyright_entity: "Potato AG"
line_length: 100
suppress_rule: "operator_whitespace"
</pre>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Turn MISS_HIT on again in selected sub-directories. As
	    time progresses, gradually enable for more and more
	    sub-directories.
<pre>
enable: true
</pre>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Eventually remove all individual config files and turn
	    MISS_HIT on in the top-level configuration.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dealing with external projects</h2>
      <div>
	Larger, more complex projects may include source code from
	other projects or repositories. MISS_HIT includes several
	features to deal with this.
      </div>
      <div>
	There are essentially two scenarios:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Cooperating - the included source, project, or
	    repository also uses MISS_HIT.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Non-cooperating - the included source, project, or
	    repository does not use MISS_HIT, or uses a much older
	    version (newer versions likely generate more messages).
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </div>
      <div>
	If the included code has its own <tt>miss_hit.cfg</tt> file
	with a <tt>project_root</tt> directive, then everything will
	work without further action: the <tt>project_root</tt>
	directive will stop the inheriting mechanism of configuration
	files, so any files in this included project will be analysed
	in their intended way.
      </div>
      <div>
	If a project is not cooperating then the best option is to
	place a configuration file in the parent directory, excluding
	the non-cooperating project from analysis. For example if the
	directory structure is as follows:
<pre>
/
  src
  external
    other_a
    other_b
</pre>
        Then add the following to the root configuration file:
        <pre>exclude_dir: "external"</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This will cause any MISS_HIT tools to completely skip these
	directories.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><a name="shared-code">Dealing with multiple programs and shared code</a></h2>

      <div>
	MISS_HIT has special support for large shared repositories
	with multiple systems and shared code. While tools like MH
	Style will likely be run on <i>all</i> code, all the time,
	this does not make sense for other tools like MH
	Metric. Instead here you will likely want to create multiple
	reports, one for each component.
      </div>

      <div>
	Consider for example a repository with the following layout:
<pre>
  /
    components/
      swc/
        potato/
          src/
          test/
        kitten/
          src/
          test/
      libs/
        common/
          src/
          test/
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
	Both the <tt>potato</tt> and <tt>kitten</tt> program depend on
	the <tt>common</tt> code. If I want to produce the code metric
	report for just <tt>kitten</tt>, I would have to carefully
	name each directory:
	<pre>mh_metric components/swc/potato/src components/libs/common/src</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
	With some configuration we can make this easier. First, we can
	define a library by adding a config file
	in <tt>components/libs/common/miss_hit.cfg</tt>:
<pre>
library "Common" {
  paths {
    "src"
  }
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
	What this does is create a globally available library
	called <tt>Common</tt>. It's deliverable code is
	in <tt>src</tt>, but <tt>test</tt> is not. This is identical
	to how you would set up your matlabpath (in MATLAB) or path
	(in Octave).
      </div>

      <div>
	Next, we want to declare our two programs. To do this
	for <tt>kitten</tt> program, we create an entry-point
	in <tt>components/swc/kitten/miss_hit.cfg</tt>:
<pre>
entrypoint "Kitten_SWC" {
  paths {
    "src"
  }
  libraries {
    "Common"
  }
}
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
	You can now analyze <tt>kitten</tt> anywhere by using
	the <a href="cli.html#entry-point">entry-point</a>
	command-line option:
	<pre>mh_metric --entry-point=Kitten_SWC</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
	Note: Currently this feature is just a nice shot-cut to
	existing functionality. In the future, this will be required
	for performing any kind of advanced static analysis.

      <h1>Configuration file Reference</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Naming</h2>
      <div>
	A configuration file must have one of the following names:
	<ul>
	  <li><tt>miss_hit.cfg</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>.miss_hit</tt></li>
	</ul>
	It is recommended to use <tt>miss_hit.cfg</tt>, except for the
	root directory of your project.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <div>
	Configuration files apply to all files in the directory they
	are placed in (including any files in sub-directories).
      </div>
      <div>
	A configuration file in a sub-directory inherits all options
	valid in the parent directory, and then subsequently
	over-rides any options it wants to.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Root</h2>
      <div>
	A project root is the basic configuration and is initially set
	to all default values.
      </div>
      <div>
	A project root is any directory that fulfils one or more of
	the following:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Contains configuration file with the <tt>project_root</tt>
	    directive
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Was excluded by a <tt>exclude_dir</tt> directive
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <div>
	Grammar:
<pre>
DIRECTIVE ::= PROJECT_ROOT
            | GLOBAL_ENABLE
            | STYLE_APPLICATION
            | STYLE_CONFIGURATION
            | METRIC_LIMIT
            | DIALECT
            | EXCLUSION
            | PROJECT_DIRECTIVE

CONFIG_FILE ::= { DIRECTIVE } EOF_OF_FILE
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	A configuration contains comments (starting with <tt>#</tt>)
	and configuration directives. Each directive ideally should be
	separated by one or more new lines (but this is optional).
      </div>
      <div>
	Configuration directives are processed sequentially. I.e. if
	two directives conflict, then the latest one takes precedence.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Values</h2>
      <div>
	Directives often contain values, typeset in all-caps. This
	section defines the syntax for each value.
      </div>

      <h3>BOOLEAN</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>BOOLEAN ::= false | true | 0 | 1</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	Note the numeric form is here for backwards-compatibility. It
	is recommended to use the <tt>false</tt> and <tt>true</tt>
	literals instead.
      </div>

      <h3>STRING</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>STRING ::= &lt;double-quoted-string&gt;</pre>
      </div>

      <h3>INTEGER</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>STRING ::= &lt;non-negative-integer&gt;</pre>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Directives</h2>

      <h3>Project Root</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>PROJECT_ROOT ::= project_root</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive means we do not inherit configuration from our
	parent directory, but instead we start from a clean (default)
	slate. It is recommended to place this directive in the top
	level of your project.
      </div>

      <h3>Global enable/disable</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>GLOBAL_ENABLE ::= enable ':' BOOLEAN </pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive completely enables or disables all miss_hit
	tools. This is especially useful if you have a large legacy
	code-base that you're slowly transitioning. In this use-case
	you have <tt>enable: false</tt> in your project root, and
	individual components overwrite it again with <tt>enable:
	true</tt> on a case-by-case basis.
      </div>

      <h3>Style rule application</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar:
<pre>
STYLE_APPLICATION ::= enable_rule ':' STRING
                    | suppress_rule ':' STRING
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive turns style rules on or off. The given string
	must refer to a <a href="style_checker.html">valid style
	rule</a>.
      </div>
      <div>
	Please note that any configuration associatd with a style rule
	is not affected by this directive. For example you can
	set <tt>line_length</tt> and then turn the corresponding rule
	on and off without having to re-specify the acceptable line
	length.
      </div>

      <h3>Style configuration application</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar:
<pre>
STYLE_CONFIGURATION ::= IDENTIFIER ':' STRING
                      | IDENTIFIER ':' INTEGER
                      | IDENTIFIER ':' BOOLEAN
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive configures a particular style rule. The
	identifier must refer to a <a href="style_checker.html">valid
	rule parameter</a>.
      </div>

      <h3>Metric configuration</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar:
<pre>
METRIC_NAME ::= STRING
METRIC_OR_WC ::= METRIC_NAME | '*'
METRIC_LIMIT ::= metric METRIC_OR_WC ':' report
               | metric METRIC_OR_WC ':' ignore
               | metric METRIC_NAME  ':' limit INTEGER
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive configures a particular code metric. The metric
	name must refer to a <a href="metrics.html">valid code
	metric</a>. Using the wild-card means this directive applies
	to all metrics MISS_HIT supports.
      </div>
      <div>
	When <tt>report</tt> is specified, a metric is measured and
	included in the final report, but no limits are checked or
	enforced.
      </div>
      <div>
	When <tt>ignore</tt> is specified, a metric is not measured
	and not included in the final report. Use this to completely
	remove metrics you don't care about.
      </div>
      <div>
	When <tt>limit</tt> is specified, the measured metric must be
	less than or equal to the given number; otherwise a message is
	generated by mh_metric. (But these can be justified by special
	comments in the code, please refer to
	the <a href="metrics.html">mh_metric manual</a>.)
      </div>

      <h3>Language dialect</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>DIALECT ::= octave ':' BOOLEAN</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive controls which language is processed by
	MISS_HIT. By default we process MATLAB, but if this is set to
	true we instead process Octave.
      </div>
      <div>
	Please note that Octave support is limited right now, but I
	consider it a medium/long term priority.
      </div>

      <h3>Directory exclusion</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>EXCLUSION ::= exclude_dir ':' STRING</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive completely removes a directory from
	consideration, and makes them project roots.
      </div>
      <div>
	MISS_HIT will not enter such directories, unless explicitly
	demanded. For example, consider this directory structure:
<pre>
root
  / miss_hit.cfg (which excludes kitten)
  / potato
      / foo.m
      / bar.m
  / kitten
      / baz.m
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	Assume the user is in <tt>root</tt>.
	<pre>$ mh_style .</pre>
	This command will analyse two files, <tt>foo.m</tt> and <tt>bar.m</tt>.

	<pre>$ mh_style kitten/baz.m</pre>
	This command will analyse one
	file, <tt>baz.m</tt>. Furthermore, because <tt>kitten</tt> is
	considered a project root, any configuration
	from <tt>root</tt> is entirely ignored.
      </div>

      <h3><a name="projects">Projects</a></h3>
      <div>
	Grammar:
<pre>
PROJECT_DIRECTIVE ::= LIBRARY_DECLARATION
                    | ENTRYPOINT_DECLARATION

LIBRARY_DECLARATION ::= library [ STRING ] LIBRARY_PROPERTIES
LIBRARY_PROPERTIES ::= '{' [ LIBRARY_PROPERTY { ',' LIBRARY_PROPERTY } ] '}

ENTRYPOINT_DECLARATION ::= entrypoint STRING ENTRYPOINT_PROPERTIES
ENTRYPOINT_PROPERTIES ::= '{' [ ENTRYPOINT_PROPERTY { ',' ENTRYPOINT_PROPERTY } ] '}'

OPTIONAL_STRING_LIST ::= [ STRING_LIST ]
STRING_LIST ::= STRING { ',' STRING }

PATH_LIST ::= paths '{' OPTIONAL_STRING_LIST '}

LIBRARY_PROPERTY ::= PATH_LIST

ENTRYPOINT_PROPERTY ::= libraries '{' OPTIONAL_STRING_LIST '}'
                      | PATH_LIST
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
	A library declaration defines (an optionally named) library,
	which is essentially a set of paths that will be searched for
	functions and classes. If no name is given, the name of the
	library defaults to the directory name. By default only the
	directory containing the configuration directive is searched,
	but this can be overridden by a path list. The items in the
	path list may contain wild-cards.
      </div>

      <div>
	An entrypoint declares a program or system, which may depend
	on a list of libraries.
      </div>

      <h4>Future plans</h4>
      <div>
	In the future an entry point will also be able to name a
	specific function or member function that serves as the main
	function for this system, allowing static analysis to detect
	e.g. unused code.
      </div>

      <div>
	Another planned feature are "global" libraries that are
	automatically a dependency of every library or entry point.
